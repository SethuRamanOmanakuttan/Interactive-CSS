# Interactive CSS Webpage

This repository contains a webpage designed to demonstrate interactive CSS features. Users can manipulate CSS properties in real time, like padding, margin, and border of an HTML element.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file.
- `css/style.css`: Contains the general styles for the webpage.
- `css/slider.css`: Contains the styles for the sliders.
- `js/main.js`: The JavaScript file that handles the interactivity.

## Usage

You can view the website [here](https://sethuramanomanakuttan.github.io/Interactive-CSS/)

## Future Work

We plan to add more interactive CSS examples to this page in the future, allowing users to experiment with other CSS properties and see the effects in real time. This will be an excellent tool for learning CSS and understanding how different properties affect the appearance and layout of HTML elements.
